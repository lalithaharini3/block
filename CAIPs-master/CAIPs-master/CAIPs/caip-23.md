## Simple Summary

This document is about the details of the Filecoin network namespace and reference for CAIP-2.

## Abstract

In CAIP-2 a general blockchain identification scheme is defined. This is the
implementation of CAIP-2 for Filecoin network.

## Motivation

See CAIP-2.

## Specification

### Filecoin Namespace

The namespace "fil" refers to the wider Filecoin ecosystem.

#### Reference Definition

The reference relies on Filecoin's current designation of addresses belonging to test or main networks by prefixing them
with `t` or `f` correspondingly.

Reference could only be populated with `f` or `t` symbols.

## Rationale

Blockchains in the "filecoin" namespace are [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) blockchains, i.e. Filecoin mainnet, Filecoin testnet, and few devnets.

## Backwards Compatibility

Not applicable

## Test Cases

This is a list of manually composed examples

```
# Testnet and Devnets
fil:t

# Mainnet
fil:f
```
