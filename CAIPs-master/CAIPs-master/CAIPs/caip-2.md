## Simple Summary

CAIP-2 defines a way to identify a blockchain (e.g. Ethereum Mainnet, GÃ¶rli, Bitcoin, Cosmos Hub) in a human-readable, developer-friendly and transaction-friendly way.

## Abstract

Often you need to reference a blockchain, for example when you want to state where some asset or smart contract is located. In Ethereum the [EIP155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) chain ID is used most of the time. But with an Ethereum chain ID you cannot reference e.g. a Bitcoin or Cosmos chain.

## Motivation

The final trigger to create this CAIP (and the CAIP process itself) was a discussion around [EIP2256] at [Ethereum-Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-2256-add-wallet-getownedtokens-json-rpc-method/3600/14).
Independently, the [Universal Chain Registry](https://github.com/UCRegistry) was created that needs properly specified chain identifiers at its core. A [discussion about the network ID format](https://github.com/UCRegistry/registry/pull/13) brought this group together with ChainAgnostic.

## Specification

The blockchain ID (short "chain ID") is a string designed to uniquely identify blockchains in a developer-friendly fashion.

### Syntax

The `chain_id` is a case-sensitive string in the form

```
chain_id:    namespace + ":" + reference
namespace:   [-a-z0-9]{3,8}
reference:   [-_a-zA-Z0-9]{1,32}
```

### Semantics

Each `namespace` covers a class of similar blockchains. Usually it describes an ecosystem or standard, such as e.g. `cosmos` or `eip155`.
One namespace should refer to one resolution method to resolve the chain's reference. A `reference` is a way to identify a blockchain within a given namespace.
The semantics as well as the more granular syntax which are delegated to each namespace specification shall be defined in separate CAIPs describing resolution methods.

## Rationale

The goals of the general chain ID format is:

- Uniqueness within the entire blockchain ecosystem
- To some degree human-readable and helps for basic debugging
- Restricted in a way that it can be stored on chain
- Character set basic enough to display in hardware wallets as part of a transaction content

The following secondary goals can easily be achieved:

- Can be used unescaped in URL paths
- Can be used as filename in a case-sensitive UNIX file system (Linux/git).

These secondary goals have been given up along the way:

- Can be used as filename in a case-insensitive UNIX file system (macOS).
- Can be used as filename in a Windows file system.
