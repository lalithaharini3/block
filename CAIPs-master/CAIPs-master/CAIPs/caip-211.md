## Simple Summary

CAIP-211 defines the behavior and semantics for both implicit and explicit RPC
documents (which define methods and notifications for a given namespace or scope
within one) and RPC endpoints (i.e. preferential routing for specific nodes). 

## Abstract

Without a profile of this CAIP which defines implicit values for a given
namespace, setting the `rpcDocuments` and `rpcEndpoints` values in the
`scopeObject`s of a [CAIP-25][] negotiation could be seen as a security risk
within that namespace, since either a custom endpoint or a custom re-definition
of a common method or event syntax or semantics would be harder for the
respondent to detect. Once those implicit values have been profiled and
published, however, the meaning of any explicit values in [CAIP-25][]
negotiations or other scope expressions have an explicit baseline making RPC
security postures more deterministic.

## Motivation

This deterministic expression of variations in RPC routing and behavior is a
precondition for explicit and informed user consent to be gotten about these
variations, in addition to supporting clarity between the multiple agents
connecting that consenting user to a network. This enables flexible and layered mechanism for
negotiating authorities over routing and RPC method/notification definitions. In
turn, this allows experimentation and extension within certain local contexts
(like a specific network within a namespace, or a specific community of usage of
a network) without compromising the integrity and security of the broader
community.

## Specification

### Implicit values

Many namespaces have a single, authoritative RPC definition (whether
human-readable, machine-readable, or both) and a set of endpoints which can be
considered definitive. Where these can be referred to by a static URI and this
URI is described in a [namespace profile][namespaces] of this CAIP, these static
URIs are the "implicit" endpoint and document values for those namespaces.

For a given namespace `X`, if the implicit RPC endpoints are `Y1`, `Y2` and
`Y3`, and the implicit RPC document is `Z`, then the scope object

```jsonc
{
  "X": {
    methods: [A, B, C],
    notifications: [D, E, F]
  }
}
```

SHOULD be interpreted as equivalent to the scope object: 

```jsonc
{
  "X": {
    methods: [A, B, C],
    notifications: [D, E, F],
    rpcEndpoints: [Y1, Y2, Y3],
    rpcDocuments: [Z]
  }
}
```

### Explicit values

Additional values may be set for a given `scopeObject`. 

### Ordering 

In the case of `rpcEndpoints`, priority is contextual and not defined
universally. In the case of `rpcDocuments`, priority is more definitive: each
document after the first MUST only add (and MUST NOT re-define) any terms
already defined, iteratively through the array.

For this reason, if a namespace has defined stable URIs for default
`rpcDocuments` and `rpcEndpoints`, these SHOULD be defined in a namespace
profile. These implicit values allow extensions and variations from those
defaults to be negotiated, such as by [CAIP-25][] or other discovery protocols.

In the context of a CAIP-25 negotiation, a requesting party may define explicit
values for `rpcEndpoints` or `rpcDocuments` without including the implicit
values. Extending the example above, we could say that the request:

```jsonc
{
  "X": {
    methods: [A, B, C],
    notifications: [D, E, F],
    rpcEndpoints: [U1, U2, U3],
    rpcDocuments: [V]
  }
}
```
MUST be interpreted as replacing rather than appending to the implicit values.
It MUST NOT be interpreted as equivalent to:

```jsonc
{
  "X": {
    methods: [A, B, C],
    notifications: [D, E, F],
    rpcEndpoints: [Y1, Y2, Y3, U1, U2, U3],
    rpcDocuments: [Z, V]
  }
}
```

## Security Considerations

The main security risk in accepting multiple authorities (expressed as URIs,
which may be mutable) is that ambiguity and undesired behavior can arise from
multiple RPC documents defining the same term, or different endpoints producing
different outcomes. The solution to this is to assign priority by array ordering
in the context of negotiation. In a protocol like [CAIP-25][], this means
achieving consensus between parties on the exact priority before initiating a
session.

### CAIP-25 Example

Since [CAIP-25][] obligates both parties in an authorization negotiation to
persist and honor whatever `scopeObject`s they agree to, including the ordering
of arrays, it is important to resolve all implicit and explicit members at the
same negotiation step where `requiredScopes` and `optionalScopes` get merged
into the `sessionScopes` both parties will persist. We can illustrate this
resolution and all the possibilities open to a respondent by extending the
examples above, in which a request omits implicit values Y1, Y2, Y3, and Z:

```jsonc
{
  "requiredScopes": {
    "X": {
      methods: [A, B, C],
      notifications: [D, E, F],
    }
  },
  "optionalScopes": {
    "X": {
      methods: [A, B, C],
      notifications: [D, E, F],
      rpcEndpoints: [U1, U2, U3],
      rpcDocuments: [V]
    }
  },
}
```

Since the ordering of arrays expresses authority or priority in case of
conflicts, we can illustrate three different security postures, explained below:

```jsonc

// Security Posture 1: Implicit value prioritized, requested values treated as extensions
{
  ...
  "sessionScopes": {
    "X": {
      methods: [A, B, C],
      notifications: [D, E, F],
      rpcEndpoints: [Y1, Y2, Y3, U1, U2, U3],
      rpcDocuments: [Z, V]
    }
  }
  ...
}

// Security Posture 2: Explicit prioritized, but implicit values preserved
{
  ...
  "sessionScopes": {
    "X": {
      methods: [A, B, C],
      notifications: [D, E, F],
      rpcEndpoints: [U1, U2, U3, Y1, Y2, Y3],
      rpcDocuments: [V, Z]
    }
  }
  ...
}

//Security Posture 3: Requested values only, explicit deauthorization of implicit values.
{
  ...
  "sessionScopes": {
    "X": {
      methods: [A, B, C],
      notifications: [D, E, F],
      rpcEndpoints: [Y1, Y2, Y3],
      rpcDocuments: [Z]
    }
  }
  ...
}

```

Option 1 would be the overwhelmingly most common, since implicit values are
essentially the baseline consensus of an entire namespace (i.e. its network-wide
basic RPC vocabulary), and any possible conflict between this and an extension
should be sandboxed by not allowing an extension to override baseline.

Option 2 would likely be quite rare, as a respondent and/or its controlling
end-user would have to have a lot of out-of-band trust in an extension or local
authority to allow it to override systemwide defaults. This could be thought of
as "advanced mode" or "high-trust mode", and likely only enabled for a subset of
end-users, perhaps negotiated by progressive re-authorization over time.

Similarly, Option 3 would only make sense in special cases with meaningful
consent of an end-user that knows they are entering a special-case and familiar
UX and security assumptions. It could be thought of as "developer mode" or
"alternate network configuration", and would getting meaningful consent from
the end-user.

Note that these three options are not exhaustive, just illustrative, and many
combinations are also possible, i.e. combining the `rpcDocuments` in Option 1
with the  `rpcEndpoints` value in Option 2.

## Privacy Considerations

The trust model of custom RPC endpoints and/or definition documents is complex
and reputation/discovery systems are still emerging on a per-chain basis in many
ecosystems. For this reason, negotiation protocols like [CAIP-25][] are best
constructive iteratively and progressively to avoid malicious dapps partially
deanonymizing wallets by profiling their support for custom RPCs (e.g., by
"overasking" upfront).  For this reason, as with the initial CAIP-25 exchange,
discovery requests rejected due to user input, due to security policy, and due
to non-support at the wallet software level should not be distinguished at the
RPC level.
